* Mount [Lewotobi Laki Laki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewotobi "Lewotobi"), one of [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia")'s most active volcanoes, erupts for a second consecutive day, sending a column of volcanic materials and ash up to 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky. Saturday’s eruption was one of Indonesia’s largest since 2010 when [Mount Merapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Merapi "Mount Merapi") erupted. No casualties are reported.
