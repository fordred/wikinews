#### Disasters and accidents

* [Krasheninnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasheninnikov_%28volcano%29 "Krasheninnikov (volcano)"), a volcano on Russia's [Kamchatka Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka_Peninsula "Kamchatka Peninsula"), erupts for the first time since the 15th century, and the first to be historically recorded. The eruption takes place four days after a [magnitude 8.8 earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Kamchatka_Peninsula_earthquake "2025 Kamchatka Peninsula earthquake") hit the same region on July 30, which may have contributed to the eruption.
