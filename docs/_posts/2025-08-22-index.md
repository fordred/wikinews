#### Armed conflicts and attacks

* [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict "Israeli-Palestinian conflict")
  * [Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
    * [Gaza Strip famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip_famine "Gaza Strip famine")
      * The [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") has, via the UN-backed [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Food_Security_Phase_Classification "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification"), for the first time officially declared a famine in Gaza, especially in the [Gaza City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City") area. The [OHCHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights") states the famine is the "direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government“ and "may also amount to the [war crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_%28crime%29 "Starvation (crime)") of willful killing.“ Israel rejects any accusation of a famine in Gaza.
