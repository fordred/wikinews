    - [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") agree to a united states extend ceasefire plan through [Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan "Ramadan") and [Passover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover "Passover"), during which half of the 59 [remaining hostages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war_hostage_crisis "Gaza war hostage crisis") will be released alive or dead.
